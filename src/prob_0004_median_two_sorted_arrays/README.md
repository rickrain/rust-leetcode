# Median of Two Sorted Arrays

[Back to root-level README](../../README.md)

## Introduction

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return **the median** of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

## Examples 

**Example 1:**

```console
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```console
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
```

## Constraints

- `nums1.length == m`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m <= 1000`
- `0 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= m + n <= 2000`
- `-106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106`
